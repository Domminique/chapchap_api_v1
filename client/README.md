Chapchap eloistics, 

Everyone involved in the development, consumption, discussion,and regulation of Generative AI should strive to manage the following identified risks:

Erosion of trust | Malicious‚Äîhallucination,deepfakes, phishing, and prompt injection26 ‚Äîand ambivalent actors‚Äînot citing data sources‚Äîcan expose the attack surface and erode customer trust.

Security and risk | Companies should stay ahead of a rapidly evolving regulatory landscape while maintaining confidentiality of data, embeddings, and tuning with inherently ‚Äúmulti-tenant‚Äù models.

Bias and discrimination | Generative AI is prone to mimicking biases and propagating discriminatory behavior if implemented without guardrails and continuous monitoring.

Data privacy and IP obscurity | Models will be trained on a corpus of proprietary, often private data requiring regulatory compliance, node isolation, and source traceability.

Costs | Costs of a query/prompt using Generative AI can cost up to ten times27 that of an index-based query. While these costs will likely come down over time, the economics should be factored into internal business cases and customer pricing to drive adoption.

Long-term worker displacement | Today, the highest ROI use cases will augment workflows and drive productivity; however,as models advance, there may be a risk of job displacement without proper upskilling and workforce planning.

It's crucial to approach wealth management with a long-term perspective, seeking professional advice, and being mindful of your financial goals. Ultimately, the goal is to achieve financial stability, security, and a fulfilling life.







How we build chapchap, 
1. collect datasets from government to kick start our project.

2. Intsllaed You can use MongoDB for Visual Studio Code to:

Explore your MongoDB Data.

Prototype queries and run MongoDB commands.

Create a Shared Tier Atlas cluster using a Terraform template.

MongoDB for VS Code makes it easy to work with your data in MongoDB directly from your VS Code environment. MongoDB for VS Code is the perfect companion for MongoDB Atlas, but you can also use it with your self-managed MongoDB instances.

Providing a connection string is faster and easier than filling in a deployment's details. Use this option if Atlas hosts your deployment or if you have a connection string for a deployment available.

MongoDB Playgrounds are JavaScript environments where you can prototype queries, aggregations, and MongoDB commands with helpful syntax highlighting.

I just used to store data with mongoDB , I didnt know it do do this much more!

I had everything tha i needed to work with mongoDB


-----------------------------------------------------

IMPLEMENTATION STAGE

Using MongoDB Aggregation Stages with Node.js: $match and $group
Review the following code, which demonstrates how to build the $match and $group stages of an aggregation pipeline in MongoDB with Node.js.


Using $match
Aggregation gives you a way to transform data from your collection by passing documents from one stage to another. These stages can consist of operators that transform or organize your data in a specific way. In this lesson, we used $match and $group.

The $match stage filters documents by using a simple equality match, like $match: { author: "Dave"}, or aggregation expressions using comparison operators, like $match: { likes: { $gt: 100 } }. This operator accepts a query document and passes the resulting documents to the next stage. $match should be placed early in your pipeline to reduce the number of documents to process.


Using $group
The $group stage separates documents according to a group key and returns one document for every unique group key. The group key is usually a field in the document, but it can also be an expression that resolves to a field. The $group stage can be used with aggregation expressions to perform calculations on the grouped documents. An example of this is adding up the total number of movie tickets sold by using the $sum operator:

$group: { _id: "$movie", totalTickets: { $sum: "$tickets" } }

The "$movie" is the group key, and the totalTickets field is the result of the $sum operator.

In the following code, we assign our collection name to a variable for convenience. First, we declare some variables to hold the database connection and the collection we'll use:

const client = new MongoClient(uri)
const dbname = "bank";
const collection_name = "accounts";
const accountsCollection = client.db(dbname).collection(collection_name);

Next, we build an aggregation pipeline that uses $match and $group and that will find accounts with a balance of less than $1,000. Then we group the results by the account_type, and calculate the total_balance and avg_balance for each type.

const pipeline = [
  // Stage 1: match the accounts with a balance greater than $1,000
  { $match: { balance: { $lt: 1000 } } },
  // Stage 2: Calculate average balance and total balance
  {
    $group: {
      _id: "$account_type",
      total_balance: { $sum: "$balance" },
      avg_balance: { $avg: "$balance" },
    },
  },
]
To run an aggregation pipeline, we append the aggregate method to the collection. The aggregate method takes an array of stages as an argument, which is stored in a variable. The aggregate method returns a cursor that we can iterate over to get the results.

const main = async () => {
  try {
    await client.connect()
    console.log(`Connected to the database üåç. \nFull connection string: ${safeURI}`)
    let result = await accountsCollection.aggregate(pipeline)
    for await (const doc of result) {
      console.log(doc)
    }
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(`Error connecting to the database: ${err}`)
  } finally {
    await client.close()
  }
}
